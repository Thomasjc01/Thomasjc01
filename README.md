Welcome to my personal GitHub repository! I'm a robotics enthusiast with a strong interest in **ROS**, **control systems**, and **computer vision**. This space is where I share the projects I‚Äôm working on and explore new ideas in the field of robotics.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Skills and Tools**
- **Robot Operating System (ROS)**: Building and managing robot software.
- **Control Systems**: Implementing dynamic control for robots and automation systems.
- **Computer Vision**: Enabling robots to see and understand their environment.

## üìÅ **Projects Overview**
Here's a glimpse of my ongoing and completed projects:
1. **Live Coordinate Gesture Shooter** - Utilizes camera input to detect finger gestures, enabling precise targeting and shooting based on user direction.
2. **Agricultural theme manual and autonomous Bot (ROBOCON 2024)** - Team Robocon, IIT BHU: Developed autonomous and manual bots for agricultural tasks using ROS, computer vision, and custom control strategies, integrating 2D LIDAR, IMU, and YOLO for object detection and navigation.
3. **Path planning and Execution for a PX4 Iris drone** - Inter IIT Prepathon: Simulated and controlled an Iris PX4 drone using ROS 2 and MAVROS for real-time obstacle avoidance and autonomous field surveys, with integrated YOLO-based weed detection and image segmentation.


## üîß **Currently Working On**
- [Smart Vision Technology for Quality Control | Flipkart Grid 6.0 2024] - Developing an advanced vision system for automated quality inspection in e-commerce using high-resolution imaging, image processing, OCR, and YOLO for real-time defect detection.
- [Advanced Cobots for Logistics in a Smart Warehouse | E-Yantra Competition 2024-2025] - Developing a logistics system using two advanced cobots, RoboArm and RoverBot, to optimize warehouse operations with package sorting, autonomous navigation, and seamless workflow integration, aligning with Industry 4.0 principles for smart city sustainability.
- [Robocon 2025 | Team Robocon IIT(BHU)] - Developing a bot for Robocon 2025 capable of dribbling, shooting, passing, and receiving a basketball using hydraulic actuators for precision, with CAD design and cost-effective hardware solutions.
